# Foobar

This is a short coding assignment, for Adeva. I was told to implement a  REST API that calls an external API service to get information about books. Additionally, I also implemented a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API with sqlite.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
1. Install all dependencies as described in the installation section above
2. Run Migrations python manage.py migrate
3. Run server python manage.py runserver. This should run on your localhost
4. To run tests, python manage.py test


##Note
I used sqlite database so you don't have to worry about DB
